            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>About</h1><p>Brett Goldstar self-trained as a mural artist during the first wave of 
acid house parties in the late 1980's. Working for some of the largest 
event organisers in the north of Britain at the time, Goldstar's unique 
artworks were seen by tens of thousands. After the thrust of free 
parties finally subsided Goldstar turned his skills to graphics, working
 freelance in London until moving to the South West of England, to 
pursue his artistic interests which had moved away from stenciling and 
towards experimentation with painting, sculpture and more recently, 
digital art. His latest series brings images together that appear to 
contradict or oppose in the first instance, his work ultimately points 
at a stream of darker connections, questions and similarities.</p></article>]]></description>
