Brett Goldstar self-trained as a mural artist during the first wave of 
acid house parties in the late 1980's. Working for some of the largest 
event organisers in the north of Britain at the time, Goldstar's unique 
artworks were seen by tens of thousands. 

After the thrust of free 
parties finally subsided Goldstar turned his skills to graphics, working
freelance in London until moving to the South West of England, to 
pursue his artistic interests which had moved away from stenciling and 
towards experimentation with painting, sculpture and more recently, 
digital art. 

His latest series brings images together that appear to 
contradict or oppose in the first instance, his work ultimately points 
at a stream of darker connections, questions and similarities

Iconic Pop Art
Can you tell a little bit your self and your background
I come from a relatively creative background, my mother was an artist, my father
a writer. As far back as I can remember I was always painting, drawing or making
something out of whatever I could lay my hands on.
I hated my art teacher at school and because of this I had zero interest in following
a career in art. After leaving school I concentrated mainly on skateboarding, girls,
music and very infrequently, A levels. In 1989 I got swept up in the second 'Summer
of Love'. A few years later, still very much involved in the scene, I moved to the
South West of England and ended up living in a shared house with a very talented
artist. She had spent the previous 18 months producing enormous, jaw droppingly
great UV backdrops for the now legendary parties such as Energy, Sunrise and
Biology. Via the vibrant South West Free Party scene I had befriended a guy who
had been organising illegal warehouse parties across the region. Off the back of their
popularity he was approached to go to the 'other side' and help organise and front the
first legal rave in the UK. By this time myself and my housemate had been let loose
in two rooms of one of the main underground clubs in the area and had covered the
walls with UV murals. Our style (think Keith Haring meets Gary Larson on acid)
which was very different to the usual offerings (think Merlin riding a Unicorn over a
Rainbow) in clubs of that genre at that time was widely acclaimed and off the back of
that we were asked to produce all the backdrops for the big legal rave.
From that point we became very busy and were soon painting full time, on the road
every weekend across the country, installing our creations. This continued for about
four years but the late nights and constant travelling pushed me into finding a more
sustainable, less exhausting way to make a living. I'd been designing club flyers
and magazine ads for promoters while I'd been painting and I already knew my way
around photoshop etc. so easily slipped into my new vocation and continued to do
this for many years. The computer became my new creative vent and over the years
I began to explore the realms of digital based art...which brings this story right up to
date. 

**You are a self-trained as a mural artist, how has been your journey in the art
industry so far? **

Pretty good. Mauger Modern Art has given me amazing exposure over the past
three years, showing my work in New York, Miami, Bangkok, Amsterdam and
London...thankfully it seems to go down well.
Did you always want to be an artist?
No, I wanted to be a milkman when I was a kid. Bob, our milkman, my inspiration,
was always really happy, he had an amazing electric vehicle full of stuff I liked to
drink and wore a cool uniform. Seemed to me like the perfect job.
Where do you go when you need inspiration?
Mainly online but also everywhere I go I get flashes of inspiration, galleries
especially...I love Tate Modern.
Your pieces are made up of smaller pictures, what is the relation between the
small pictures and the big picture?
For my first series, 'Intercontro' I used directly opposing small images to make up
the overall image. e.g 'Johnny Be Good' - Jack Nicholson's manic, grinning face
peering through the axed door made up of all the good people of the world. For the
latest series 'Idols' the small images relate to the era surrounding the person featured
in the main image. The era I choose is more relevant to my own personal experience
of the 'Idol' featured, for instance 'Maybe One Day I'll Get The Right Flesh Colour'
a self portrait of Andy Warhol is comprised of 80's iconography. Before the 80's I
didn't have a clue who he was. 

**How did you choose the pictures you want to use?**

Mainly from memory although the Internet is a great tool for refreshing it. To gather
all the images for one piece generally takes me about 4-5 days. The process, although
enjoyable is surprisingly draining. Taking a trip down memory lane, 12 hours a day, 4
days on the trot is a complete shock to my brain. Duran Duran songs stuck on internal
repeat, Rene and Renata, Eddie the Eagle and Roland Rat haunting me in my dreams.
Takes a few days to rejoin the present. 

**What has been the biggest challenge that you have faced with your work? **

Time or rather the lack of it. 

How long does it take you to create one piece, Can you explain the creative
process?
From the point I've collected all the constituent images and chosen the main image
it usually takes a couple of days so in all roughly a week from start to finish. If I told
you my process I'd have to kill you but besides my dog, photoshop is my best friend.
A lot of stuff goes on in there. 

**What pieces have caused the most attention and why? **

Most recently 'I Love Plastic' based around the classic Warhol portrait of Marilyn
Monroe. At a recent art fair the reception by the public was phenomenal. Two thirds
of the edition sold out over five days. Why? With over 480 iconic images from the
1980's I think a large percentage of people who took a deeper look at the piece were
connected with it in some way. Some so much they decided to bring it into their lives.
It's obviously great when that happens. 

**If you weren't an artist what do you think you would be doing? **

Delivering Milk. 

**What has been your greatest achivement? **

Bringing up my dog to be an amazing, considerate and thoughtful human being.
What message would you like to leave the world through your art?
Look deeper and all will be revealed. 

**Where do you see/would like to see yourself in 10 years? **

10 years more established than I am now. To be honest I find it difficult to predict
where I'll be next week. ****

**What can we expect from you next?**

Good question, I'm still working on my current series but past that perhaps larger
versions of my previous works on canvas....and I'm talking big. You'll be the first to
know when it happens....apart from my Mum. 

**What advice would you give young emerging artist?**

Develop your style, stick with it, refine it even more, produce decent body of coherent
work and don't approach a gallery until that point. 

**How do you imagine the future? **

A lot more silvery. 

**Who is/are your IDOL/s? **

My Mum. Standard.
